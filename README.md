# Fruit-Game-3D
This is a Final Project of a lecture in NCKU. 

This is the first time me and my teammates collab on unity via github, so we accidantly crashed the repo. The original commits and branches could be found at https://github.com/bullyee/UnityFinal.

========================================

This game is inspired by Suica Game, simply a Suica game but in 3D Graphics.
I would like to mention https://soundcloud.com/sakuragirl_official for the musics i use in the game.
Also, great thanks to the creators https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/35697, https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/57827 and https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/62593 for the free unity assets i used.

========================================

Gameplay 
There is gameplay instruction button "?" in the top right corner in the first scene of the game.
The "X" above it simply closes the game.
To flip the page in the gameplay instruction, drag the bottom part of each page and flip it.
Shortly going through the gameplay instruction, WASD for movement, shift for slower movements, right key for ball drop, left key to toggle indicator, scroll for zoom in/out. Pile them up in the box and Merge the same fruits - until they get bigger and bigger, and your score grows higher and higher!! If you have reached the top of the box (touch the red plane on top of it), the game ends.
